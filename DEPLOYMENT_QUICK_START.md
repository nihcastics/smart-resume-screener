- `HF_SPACES_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed step-by-step guide

‚úÖ **Optimized for Free Tier**
- Single uvicorn worker (saves memory)
- Python 3.11 slim-bullseye base image
- All ML models included (torch, transformers, faiss, etc.)
- Total size: ~3GB (fits in HF Spaces 50GB storage)

‚úÖ **Pushed to GitHub**
- All code on `main` branch
- Ready to deploy to HF Spaces

## What You Need to Do (5 Steps)

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Create HF Space
- Go to: https://huggingface.co/new-space
- **Name**: `smart-resume-screener-backend`
- **SDK**: `Docker` (IMPORTANT!)
- **Hardware**: `CPU basic` (free)

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Add Environment Variables
In Space Settings, add these 6 variables:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY = [your key]
JWT_SECRET = any-secret-string-here
DATABASE_URL = [your Supabase URL]
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME = gemini-pro
SENTENCE_MODEL_NAME = all-MiniLM-L6-v2
PYTHONUNBUFFERED = 1
```

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Get HF Token
- Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
- Click **New token** ‚Üí **Write** access
- Copy your token (save it!)

### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Push Code to HF Spaces
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\jenny\Downloads\Final Resume Screener\smart-resume-screener"
git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/smart-resume-screener-backend
git push hf main --force
```
(When asked for password, use your HF token)

### Step 5Ô∏è‚É£: Wait & Test
- Wait 10-15 minutes for build to complete
- Check: `https://YOUR_USERNAME-smart-resume-screener-backend.hf.space/health`
- Should see: `{"status": "healthy"}`

## After Backend is Deployed

### Update Vercel Frontend
1. Add environment variable in Vercel dashboard:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://YOUR_USERNAME-smart-resume-screener-backend.hf.space`

2. Redeploy frontend (Vercel auto-deploys)

### Test End-to-End
1. Go to Vercel frontend URL
2. Register/Login
3. Upload resume + job description
4. Click Analyze
5. ‚úÖ Should work perfectly!

## Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Main FastAPI application |
| `Dockerfile.hf` | Docker image configuration |
| `HF_SPACES_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | Detailed deployment steps |
| `backend/requirements.txt` | All Python dependencies |
| `backend/main.py` | Original backend (still working) |

## Important Notes

‚è±Ô∏è **First request is slow (30-60 seconds)**
- ML models load on first request
- Subsequent requests are much faster
- This is normal behavior

üîÑ **Auto-sleep and wake**
- HF Spaces hibernates after inactivity
- Wakes up automatically when you access it
- No data loss

üí∞ **100% FREE**
- No credit card required
- No costs
- Unlimited storage for code

## Troubleshooting Quick Links

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Build failed | Check **Build logs** in HF Space |
| App crashes | Check **Logs** in HF Space (models loading) |
| Can't push code | Use HF token as password, not your HF password |
| Frontend CORS error | Make sure `VITE_API_URL` is set in Vercel |
| Slow startup | Wait 2-3 minutes for models to load (first time only) |
